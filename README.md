## 📊 UK Subsidy Data Analysis

This project explores and analyses the UK Subsidy Award and Scheme datasets with a focus on transparency, policy relevance, and data-driven insights. The work is grounded in thorough data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), using Python and pandas to uncover patterns in how public subsidies have been distributed across sectors, regions, and time.

Key areas of analysis include:
- Trends in subsidy amounts and counts over time, especially during the COVID-19 interim period (2021–2023)
- Breakdown of subsidies by purpose (`simplified_category`), recipient size, and form
- Identification of outliers and anomalies in award values
- Reproduction of key statistics from official government reports
- Visual summaries such as area plots, heatmaps, and word clouds to communicate findings clearly

The notebook is designed to be reproducible and well-documented, making it a useful reference for analysts, researchers, and anyone interested in UK public finance and subsidy transparency.
